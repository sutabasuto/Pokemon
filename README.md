# Pokemon
"The goal of this one-week project was to create a console-based Pokemon game in C++, with the aim of gaining a deep understanding of designing and implementing an object-oriented architecture for a text-based combat game. This involved working with data formats to store and load game values, as well as organizing and structuring source code and project files."
> "To finish and re-code."
